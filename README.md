#  Proyecto Cotizador-react-vite (FINALIZADO)

Cotizador

React - Vite - Tailwind

I have created this calculator using React, Tailwind, and Vite. I used React components to develop an interactive user interface. I customized the styles using Tailwind CSS, a CSS utility library that allowed me to achieve an attractive and tailored visual appearance. Additionally, I chose Vite as a fast development environment, which facilitated the setup and build process of the project.

In my calculator, I made use of local states and the useEffect hook in React to handle the update logic and calculations. The local states, implemented with the useState hook, allowed me to store and update specific values within the component. I leveraged the useEffect hook to perform secondary actions when changes occurred in the local states, such as calculating the total amount to be paid based on the selected quantity and months.

With this calculator, users can adjust the desired quantity and payment term using a slider and a dropdown menu, respectively. Each time these values are modified, my calculator automatically updates the payment summary. In the summary, I display the selected number of months, the total amount to be paid, and the monthly installment. I take pride in achieving a smooth interaction among the components, local states, and the useEffect hook in React.

This calculator I have developed proves to be very useful for quickly calculating the total amount and monthly installments for a loan or other financial scenarios that require interactive and accurate calculations. Thanks to React, Tailwind, and Vite, I managed to create a seamless user experience and an appealing interface that meets my needs.
